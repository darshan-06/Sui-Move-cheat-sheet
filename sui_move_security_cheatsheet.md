# Sui Move Security Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Sui Move is the smart contract programming language used on the Sui blockchain. It emphasizes security by leveraging strong static typing, resource safety, and explicit state management. This cheat sheet covers key security principles, best practices, common pitfalls, and Sui-specific considerations to help you develop secure Sui Move modules.

## Security Principles in Sui Move

### Resource Safety
- **Linear Types:** Resources in Move are linear types. They can be moved but not copied or implicitly dropped, which prevents accidental duplication or loss.
- **Ownership Semantics:** Ensure that every resource is explicitly owned. This prevents unauthorized transfers and helps maintain clear state transitions.

### Access Control
- **Capabilities:** Utilize the capability pattern to restrict access to sensitive operations.
- **Explicit Authorization:** Always verify the caller’s identity or provided capabilities before executing state-altering actions.

### Encapsulation & Module Boundaries
- **Minimal Interfaces:** Expose only the necessary functions and data structures. This reduces the attack surface.
- **Private Implementation:** Keep internal logic hidden from external modules to avoid unintended interactions.

## Best Practices

### Invariant Checks
- Use `assert!` statements to enforce invariants at both the start and end of function execution.
- Validate state transitions to ensure that all pre- and post-conditions are met.

### Error Handling
- Return clear and informative error codes.
- Ensure that error paths are handled gracefully and that no state corruption occurs during failures.

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for each function.
- Avoid exposing critical operations that could be exploited if accessed by unauthorized parties.

### Code Simplicity & Clarity
- Keep your code simple and straightforward—simple code is easier to audit and maintain.
- Regularly refactor to reduce complexity and improve readability.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Pitfalls

### Reentrancy
- Although Move’s design minimizes reentrancy risks through resource safety, avoid complex callback patterns that might lead to unexpected interactions.
- Finalize all state updates before invoking external calls.

### Inadequate Authorization
- Never assume that the caller is authorized. Always implement explicit checks for identity or capabilities.
- Carefully review public interfaces to ensure that no sensitive functions are inadvertently exposed.

### Race Conditions
- Be mindful of Sui's concurrent transaction model. Ensure that resource access is well-synchronized to avoid conflicts.
- Simulate concurrent transaction scenarios during testing to identify potential race conditions.

### Resource Mismanagement
- Improper handling of resources can lead to lost or locked assets.
- Verify that all resources are correctly initialized, transferred, and decommissioned when no longer needed.

## Testing and Auditing

### Unit Testing
- Develop comprehensive unit tests for every module.
- Include edge cases and error scenarios to validate that invariants hold under all conditions.

### Formal Verification
- Use available formal verification tools to mathematically prove critical invariants.
- Apply formal methods for verifying complex logic and resource management where applicable.

### Code Reviews and Audits
- Conduct regular peer reviews and engage with external security auditors.
- Stay updated with evolving best practices and integrate community feedback into your development process.

## Sui-specific Considerations

### Object Ownership in Sui
- Understand how the Sui blockchain manages object ownership and transfers.
- Ensure that metadata and state changes conform to the Sui guidelines for object management.

### Concurrency Model
- Write modules that are safe for Sui's parallel execution model.
- Test your code under scenarios that simulate concurrent transactions to uncover potential issues.

### Gas and Transaction Costs
- Optimize code with gas efficiency in mind. Security measures should not come at the expense of prohibitive transaction costs.
- Consider the impact of resource management on gas consumption.
